Hi, I am Andrey Vasenin.

I am currently living in Germany and graduating from Ruhr University Bochum with a degree in Physics. 
I am interested in working with Data and using Artificial Intelliegences for the good. 

I have built some projects using ML and Deep Learning [Github](https://github.com/andrey-09). 

It is difficult to underestimate how important the AI is gonna be. 
And I am really excited to be able to work in the field.
